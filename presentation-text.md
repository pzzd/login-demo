Hello! Today we are going to talk today about practices to prevent two categories of weaknesses from the OWASP Top 10:

- A01 Broken Access Control
- A07 Identification and Authentication Failures

These categories inclue recommendations that include coding practices, system configurations, and software architecture to make a secure system. And they can be tricky to implement because you have to take measures at every level of your stack.

For demonstration purposes, we'll look at the account creation and login component of a homemade web application. 

It's handy to look at OWASP recommendations to come up with requirements for how such a component should work.
